# Now using file I/O, write the following in the files:                  #
# File 1: “In our kitchen, however, they are faced with something so out #
# of proportion to their experience that they cannot deal with it. ”     #
# File 2: “Although we are pleased, we are also upset, because the mice  #
# behave as though there were something wrong with our kitchen. ”        #
# File 3: “There is more food lying about in our kitchen, more crumbs on #

# Here’s the complete story, “The Mice” by Lydia Davis:                  #
# Mice live in our walls but do not trouble our kitchen. We are pleased  #
# but cannot understand why they do not come into our kitchen where we   #
# have traps set, as they come into the kitchens of our neighbors.       #
# Although we are pleased, we are also upset, because the mice behave as #
# though there were something wrong with our kitchen. What makes this    #
# even more puzzling is that our house is much less tidy than the houses #
# of our neighbors. There is more food lying about in our kitchen, more  #
# crumbs on the counters and filthy scraps of onion kicked against the   #
# base of the cabinets. In fact, there is so much loose food in the      #
# kitchen I can only think the mice themselves are defeated by it. In a  #
# tidy kitchen, it is a challenge for them to find enough food night     #
# after night to survive until spring. They patiently hunt and nibble    #
# hour after hour until they are satisfied. In our kitchen, however,     #
# they are faced with something so out of proportion to their experience #
# that they cannot deal with it. They might venture out a few steps, but #
# soon the overwhelming sights and smells drive them back into their     #
# holes, uncomfortable and embarrassed at not being able to scavenge as  #
# they should.                                                           #
